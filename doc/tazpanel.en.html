<h2>English Help</h2>

<p>
	TazPanel is the SliTaz administration and settings center from where
	you can control your entire system such as package management, adding 
	or removing users, creating Live systems and much more. Navigation
	is done with the toolbar at the top of the application window and
	in some cases with a submenu.
</p>

<p>
	In most cases you will get a description and useful information with
	the section concerned. TazPanel uses the latest XHTML 5 and CSS 3 technology
	to provide a clean and easy to use frontend for all administration tasks
	you can do on SliTaz. TazPanel has also been coded from the beginning
	with speed and quality in mind and it also supports full
	internationalization.

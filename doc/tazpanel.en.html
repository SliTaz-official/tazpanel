<h2>English Help</h2>

<p>
	TazPanel is the SliTaz administration and settings center from where
	you can control your entire system such as package management, adding 
	or removing users, creating Live systems and much more. Navigation
	is done with the toolbar at the top of the application window and
	in some cases with a submenu or a side bar like in the packages interface.
</p>

<p>
	In most cases you will get a description and useful information with
	the section concerned. TazPanel uses the latest XHTML 5 and CSS 3 technology
	to provide a clean and easy to use frontend for all administration tasks
	you can do on SliTaz. TazPanel has also been coded from the beginning
	with speed and quality in mind and it also supports full
	internationalization.
</p>

<p>
	TazPanel is run as a web server on port 82 by default and can be used only
	from the local system. If you wich to control you system from a remote host
	you can change the server configuartion file to allow connections from a
	loacal network or the full world wide web, but in this last case make sure
	to set a strong password to the panel. The server configuration file is:
	/etc/slitaz/httpd.conf
</p>

	TazPanel provide a small terminal emulator wich let you execute command as
	root on the remote or local system. Not all available commands are usable
	and you should use a SSH connection for most task. That said, having access
	to a few command within the web interface can be usfull and wget is
	supported to allow file upload on a remote machine. The download directory
	is /var/www/downloads by default. All commands you can use options such as
	-R -l etc.

	TazPanel is the SliTaz administration and settings center from where
	you can control your entire system such as managing packages, adding 
	or removing users, creating Live systems and much more. Navigation
	is done with the toolbar at the top of the application window and
	in some cases with a submenu or a side bar as in the packages interface.
			</p>

			<p>
	In most cases you will get a description and useful information with
	the section concerned. TazPanel uses the latest HTML 5 and CSS 3 technology
	to provide a clean and easy to use frontend for all the administration tasks
	that you can do on SliTaz. TazPanel has also been coded from the beginning
	with speed and quality in mind and it also supports full
	internationalization.
			</p>

			<p>
	TazPanel is run as a web server on port 82 by default and can be used only
	from the local system. If you wish to control your system from a remote host
	you can change the server configuration file to allow connections from a
	local network or the entire world wide web, but in this last case make sure
	that you set a strong password for the panel. The server configuration file is
	<a data-icon="@text@" href="index.cgi?file=/etc/slitaz/httpd.conf">/etc/slitaz/httpd.conf</a>.
			</p>


			<h3>Terminal</h3>

			<p>
	TazPanel provides a small terminal emulator which lets you execute commands as
	root on the remote or local system. Not all available commands are usable
	and you should use a SSH connection for most tasks. That said, having access
	to a few commands within the web interface can be useful and <tt>wget</tt> is
	supported to allow file uploads on a remote machine. The download directory
	is <tt>/var/www/downloads</tt> by default. All commands can use options such as
	<tt>-R</tt> <tt>-l</tt> etc.

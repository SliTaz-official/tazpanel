SliTaz Web Control Panel
================================================================================


Tazpanel is the SliTaz Control Panel, a web interface who let you manage the
full system  in a redically simple way. The output xHTML code is valid xHTML 5
and all theming is done with standard CSS 3.


i18n
----
TazPanel have been coded from the beginning with gettext support. Please
forget 'echo' and use gettext, but remember that gettext "" is equivalent
to echo -n. Each script have it own TEXTDOMAIN and pot files as well, all
translations goes in the po/ folder. To start a new translation please
use msginit from the pot file directory. Example for French/France
locale (fr_FR):

	$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i tazpanel.pot

To update all translations from a newly updated the pot file:

	$ make msgmerge


User interface
--------------
If you develope an official SliTaz GUI for TazPanel, please follow the style.
If you need more CSS markup and you not a coder, please ask an official
developer the better way to implement your idea. TazPanel is fully themable
and more than one theme can be installed, this will let us make packages
for TazPanel style! All the GUI is done with xHTML 5 and CSS 3, some
javascript can be used, but with precaution... one more time, it's better
to check with a main contributor before adding to much stuff, the goal is,
as for the all SliTaz project: KISS


CGI template and files
----------------------
To start or test new function with TazPanel you will find a a file in
utils/template.cgi that need to be in the $PANEL root to work, all TazPanel
CGI scripts are in that location. If you think your code is too big to fit
in an other script you can eventually creat a new CGI page and update all
links, but please to talk to the AUTHORS before.

	* index.cgi   Main Tazpanel CGI script (some stuff may be splited
	              into users.cgi, boot.cgi, etc if too big or slow)
	* pkgs.cgi    Tazpkg packages CGI interface
	* live.cgi    All tools related to Live systems (CD, USB, Frugal)
	

Web server
----------
Tazpanel can run with Busybox httpd applet or LightTPD an propably Apache.
Start the webserver with custom config to listen only on local port for
security reason since we run as root to perform system actions, example:

# httpd -p 8090 u root -c /etc/slitaz/tazpanel-httpd.conf

Or use tazpanel cmdline:

# ./tazpanel start


Quick notes
-----------

	Panel password is defined in httpd.conf
	When cat is used: `gettext "Text to translate"`
	Devel can run the web server with root in the src tree
